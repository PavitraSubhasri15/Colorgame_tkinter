# 🎮 Text Color Identification Game

This is a fun and interactive game developed using **Tkinter** in Python.

## 🧠 Concept

In this game, a **color name** is displayed on the screen — but the **color of the text** and the **word shown** will always be different. Your task is to **type the name of the color that the text spells**, **not** the actual text color.

## ✅ Rules

- The displayed text is a randomly selected **color name**.
- The **font color** of the text will differ from the **text content**.
- You must input the **color name written** (not the font color).
- Each correct input increases your score.

## 🎯 Goal

Challenge your brain and reflexes by identifying the written color name as quickly and accurately as possible. It’s a great exercise in focus, attention, and cognitive control.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
